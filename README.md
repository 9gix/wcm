Word Control Management (WCM) (pun intended!!)

With the objective having the awesomeness of Git SCM into our word processing, for publishing documents. 
Hereby I announce the simple blogging platform. (Github)

Key advantage:
* Focus on its content (with MD syntax)
* No Coding or setup required, no pre-compile or pre-processing like Pelican or Jekyll.
* Change History is 100% preserved.

How to Start:
1. Just Create Github Repo
2. Create your post by creating a MD file.
3. Done

Todo:
1. MD to Github Pages with frontend parsing.
