# From Prison to Home for Talent

## Background

Is providing internet access a viable solution for prison for its prisoner?

## Analysis

Internet access provide a lot of knowledge for anyone. This is no exception to those behind the bar. 
If we were to provide those prisoner with Internet access, they will be able to catch up with the outside world.
Even after they were released.

What benefit does each stakeholder gain from this?

As the prison owner, they will be able to gain some earning. Each prisoner, are given a set of programming work.
They have the time to help solve outside people problem by writing a piece of software for people who needs it.
Those works are real project paid by the outside company who needs a solutions in their business.
With those earning, each prisoner will be earning some portion of those as their personal income to purchase stuff in the prison.

Aside from those good stuff, one has to be wary of the possible danger from internet access.
Each of their work and network traffic should be monitor closely, as these code can does bad stuff as well. 

For Internet access, a strict firewall, deny most site other than Google, until granted based on review if the site should be allowed.
For writing code, a code review should solve the issue, one should be able to catch any malicious code written by the prisoner.
For social media, it should be restricted, as the disadvantage outrun the benefit, one could communicate to the otherside world for aide and plan.

## Conclusion

More analysis required.
